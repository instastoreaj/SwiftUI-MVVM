## _What is MVVM?_
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:
* **Models**: Hold application data. They’re usually structs or simple classes.
* **Views**: Display visual elements and controls on the screen. They’re typically subclasses of UIView.
* **View Models**: Transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. They’re usually classes, so they can be passed around as references.
